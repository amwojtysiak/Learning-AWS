                    Tessa spent a lifetime putting a bandaid over her symptoms - food sensitivities, weight gain, digestive distress, varicose veins, blood clots, miscarriages, anxiety; you name it. She thought she was fixing them by seeing doctor after doctor and doing all the diets. In reality, her body was creating more inflammation and increasing her toxic load until they became an even longer laundry list of unexplained symptoms that wouldnâ€™t go away.

                    In October 2020, her toxin bucket overflowed. A sudden and frightening shift occurred, leading to a new problem with a frightening diagnosis. It turns out that years of exposure to the unseen toxins of mold and water-damaged bacteria is not only scary; it is more common than you think, challenging to diagnose, and even more complex to navigate. And to make matters worse, mold exposure re-activated Lyme disease and several other tick infections.

                    A lifetime of illness does not heal quickly, and while her journey to recovery is ongoing, she has made significant headway in healing.  Through hard work and commitment, she used the program she developed to identify the body's stressors, improve cellular and organ drainage, navigate food sensitivities, heal her gut her body's ability to detox, and shift her mindset. The inflammation and toxic load are decreasing, and with that, the brain fog has diminished, she has more energy to be a better mom, less pain, and her fatigue has resolved. She has also begun to shed some weight, and she doesn't remember the last time she had a panic attack or struggled with daily anxiety. Tessa believes that this health hurdle happened for a reason, and that reason was so that she may help other women navigate their health with support and clarity.

                    As a mom, your health often gets pushed to the side, when in reality, keeping you healthy is one of our most important jobs. Tessa works with other moms who struggle with exhaustion, brain fog, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms through bio-resonance and functional health testing to provide personalized support and solutions to overcome and thrive. Being tired and not feeling enough is something Tessa knows all too well.

                        I believe that it is imperative to investigate the many roots of our health. Looking at your environment, foundations, life history, and lifestyle will provide us with many clues. Navigating health doesn't need to be complicated, and returning to our roots is often the best place to start.  My clients learn how to make small changes in their food choices and lifestyle that positively affect their well-being.
